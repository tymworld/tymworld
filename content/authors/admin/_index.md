Yiming Tang is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Physics, Fudan University. He joined Prof. Guanghong Wei's research group in 2017. Since then, his research interest is focused on the self-assembly and co-assembly approach to frabocate nanostructures and functional nanomaterials. Recently, he has switched interest to the computational study of liquid-liquid phase separation in biosystems. 

He has published more than 18 papers in leading journals including Advanced Science, Advanced Materials, Angewandte Chemie, and Nature Communications.
